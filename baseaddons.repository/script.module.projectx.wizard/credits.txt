Special Thanks to the NaN Team for giving me a home when i was first starting out coding python and helping me out along the way.
This wizard wouldn't be no where near as good as it is today if it wasnt for them.

Surfacingx AfterMath   :  Thank you for developing what this wizard started as and having a program that allows people to develope a wizard.  Without this program I never would have known where to start
and i never would have been able to even get started. Also thank you for answering any questions I have had and always helping out.

TDB Wizard  :  Thank you for allowing people like myself to see your code and learn from it.  Without being able to do that I never would have learned anything about python at all.
I spent countless hours just staring at the code of your wizard to try and learn whatever I could.  Without being able to do that I never would have been able to even begin to understand anything python.
